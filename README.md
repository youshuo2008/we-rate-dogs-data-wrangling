### Project Title
WeRateDogs Twitter Tweets Analysis

### Project Description
As part of my Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree, this project focuses on Data Wrangling which is process of: gathering, assessing and cleaning data. In order to gain insights from the WeRateDogs twitter data, the first step is to gather data. For this project, the Twitter tweets information were obtained from three different sources (including querying from the twitter API). Then, all the data quality/tidiness issues were identified, documented and addressed one by one. The data cleaning efforts were recorded as a report 'wrangle_report.html'. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted on the clean dataset and interesting findings were summarized in the 'act_report.html'.    

### Files used
The 'twitter-archive-enhanced.csv' was provided by Udacity. <br />
'image_predictions.tsv' was programmatically downloaded from Udacity's server. <br />
'tweet_json.txt' was obtained by querying Twitter's API. <br />
A master dataset 'twitter_archive_master.csv' was created by merging the above three datasets by 'tweet_id'.
