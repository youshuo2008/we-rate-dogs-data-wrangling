### Project Title
WeRateDogs Twitter Analysis

### Project Description
This project focuses on Data Wrangling which is process of: gathering, assessing and cleaning data.
As part of my Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree project, I gathered WeRateDogs twitter data from three different sources (including data from the twitter API) and read in the data as three Pandas dataframe. Then I assessed each dataframe and documented all the data quality/tidiness issues found. Next, I performed data cleaning addressing the issues one by one and documented my efforts in the 'wrangle_report.html'. Finally, I did some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and generated a report for my findings ('act_report.html').
