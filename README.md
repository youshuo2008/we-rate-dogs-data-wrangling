### Project Title
WeRateDogs Twitter Tweets Analysis

### Project Description
As part of my Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree, this project focuses on Data Wrangling which is process of: gathering, assessing and cleaning data. In order to gain insights from the WeRateDogs twitter data, the first step is to gather data. For this project, the Twitter tweets information were obtained from three different sources (including querying from the twitter API). Then, all the data quality/tidiness issues were identified, documented and addressed one by one. The data cleaning efforts were recorded as a report 'wrangle_report.html'. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted on the cleaned dataset and interesting findings were revealed in the 'act_report.html'.    

### Files used
The 'twitter-archive-enhanced.csv' was provided by Udacity.
The 'image_predictions.tsv' was programmatically downloaded from Udacity's server.
The 'tweet_json.txt' file was obtained by querying Twitter's API.
A master dataset 'twitter_archive_master.csv' was created by merging the above three datasets by 'tweet_id'.

### Credits
Special thanks to my Udacity teachers: Richard Kalehoff, Juno Lee, Karl Krueger, Josh Bernhard, Sebastian Thrun, Mike Yi, Daivid Venturi, Mat Leonard, Sam Nelson, Derek Steer and mentors: Raj V and George L as well as Udacity's project reviewers.
