### Project Title
WeRateDogs Twitter Tweets Analysis

### Project Description
This project focuses on Data Wrangling which is process of: gathering, assessing and cleaning data.
As part of my Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree project, I gathered WeRateDogs twitter data from three different sources (including data from the twitter API) and read in the data as three Pandas dataframe. Then I assessed each dataframe and documented all the data quality/tidiness issues found. Next, I performed data cleaning to address the issues one by one and documented my efforts in the 'wrangle_report.html'.
Finally, I did some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and generated a report to document my findings ('act_report.html').


### Files used
The 'twitter-archive-enhanced.csv' was provided by Udacity.
The 'image_predictions.tsv' was programmatically downloaded from Udacity's server.
The 'tweet_json.txt' file was obtained by querying Twitter's API.
A master dataset 'twitter_archive_master.csv' was created by merging the above three datasets by 'tweet_id'.

### Credits
Special thanks to my Udacity teachers: Richard Kalehoff, Juno Lee, Karl Krueger, Josh Bernhard, Sebastian Thrun, Mike Yi, Daivid Venturi, Mat Leonard, Sam Nelson, Derek Steer and mentors: Raj V and George L as well as Udacity's project reviewers.
